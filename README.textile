This version is forked from "Matt Ogle's hacks for IFTFOM":https://github.com/echonest/now-playing-radiator/ that has the artist image in the background, but allows you to enter any username (and has the IFTFOM/Echo Nest hardcodings and specialisations removed).

h2. Original blurb

Handy knowing what's playing without having iTunes open, an information radiator for a shared office radio, 'now playing' screen at an awesome party. It's also&hellip;

* 100% client side - Made out of Javascript, CSS and HTML, no server side stuff. Easy to check out and run locally.
* Super adapatable - It renders well on all devices, big monitors, laptops, phones, tablets and even on the kindle.
* Totally real time - Well, it's polling, but it feels pretty snappy.
